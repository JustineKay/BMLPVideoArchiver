# BMLPVideoArchiver  

###Description  
BMLP Video Archiver is an iOS app that allows you to easily record video and immediately save the footage to your personal Google Drive account.  Your recordings are also saved to your device.  

This project is being developed for the [Black Movement - Law Project](https://bmlp.org/) to empower individuals and communities in the event of police harassment.  

It is currently in the early stages of development.  

###Basic Functionalities   
* Tap twice anywhere on camera view to begin recording  
* Video will automatically be saved to user's photo album and uploaded to user's Google Drive account after 30 seconds  
* Camera will automatically continue recording again after each 30 second recording  
* Shake the device to end the recording session and save/upload the final recording  

###Use Cases  
####Document and de-escalate violence  
* Recording police as they harass community members on the streets has served to de-escalate and deter violent police actions and to ensure they are documented when they do occur.  

####Avoid loss or unwanted deletion
* Any video that is solely saved on the phone itself,  is at risk of being deleted by police officers in attempt to cover up their misdoings or being lost should the phone be somehow damaged.  
 
####Control over your own data  
* Your recordings are saved to your personal Google Drive account, rather than funneling your personal data into anyone else's hands or attempting to gain copyright or other license over it.
